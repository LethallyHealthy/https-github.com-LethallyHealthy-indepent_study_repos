If you found yourself at the mercy of all things around you, would you be able to survive?
Would you have the wit and perserverance to continue onward, even in the face of unpredictable circumstances?
Well, if you would say yes to the prior question, then lend some of that to Jeremy.
He one day finds himself in the midst of an unforseeable development shrunken down into the size of a mere ant in the comfort of his own lawn.
Much like an ant, he is in the midst of a grassy forest, hidden under a leaf. The comfort of the shade has led him to accept his current siuation.
So, what would you advise Jeremy to do with that newfound assurance?

1. Stay under the shade
2. Step into the lawn back home.
