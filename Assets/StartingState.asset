  storyText: "If you found yourself at the mercy of all things around you, would
    you be able to survive? Well, if you would say yes to the prior question, then
    lend some of that to Jeremy. He one day finds himself in the midst of an unforseeable
    development shrunken down into the size of a mere ant in the comfort of his own
    lawn. Much like an ant, he is in the midst of a grassy forest, hidden under a
    leaf. The comfort of the shade has led him to accept his current siuation. So,
    what would you advise Jeremy to do with that newfound assurance?  \n1. Stay under
    the shade \n2. Step into the lawn back home."
